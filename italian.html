            <h3>How to navigate the article</h3>
            <p>Welcome! This article has a lot of content, so I've made sure to split it into self-contained sections you can read one at a time. In general, there are 
                two major parts to the article. Quick Information, the map of Italy, and the timeline all contain pure data on Fascism. Look at them for the "what, when, and where" 
                of Fascist Italy. The other sections are more traditional essays analyzing Italian Fascism. Read those for the "why and how" of Fascism. I've also included a 
                section on some resources you can find for free on the subject. Thanks for reading!

            <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
            <h3>General Order of Events</h3>
            <p>As a quick refresher, here are the dates of important events in the Fascist buildup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>May 1919: Mussolini hosts the first gathering of <em>Fasci</em></li>
                <li>November 1919: Italian elections result in massive left-wing victory</li>
                <li>November 1921: The National Fascist Party is officially founded</li>
                <li>1921-1922: Fascist gangs overturn local Italian governments</li>
                <li>1922: March on Rome coup makes Mussolini prime minister</li>
                <li>1922-1925: Fascist coalition government in parliament</li>
                <li>1924: Creation and failure of the <em>Aventine</em> rebellion government</li>
                <li>1925: Complete Fascist takeover of government</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Interpretations of Fascism from Italy</h3>
            <p>In the span of 3 years, from 1919 to 1922, the Fascists went from a small group of 
                200 nationalists to a party with 250,000 members building a dictatorship in a previously Liberal country. 
                As the Fascists grew in power, and especially after the March on Rome, many different Italian historians, politicians, writers, and so on 
                tried to figure out why Italian democracy had fallen so easily. We do need to be aware of the bias present in all of their interpretations. These were politicians and 
                historians forced to flee their home country due to their beliefs. They tended to project everything they saw wrong with Italian 
                society onto the Fascists. However, the interpretations of Italians who lived through these events do provide important pieces to the puzzle. The following 
                are a couple of the most popular interpretations by Italians who witnessed the fall of Italian democracy.</p>
            <p class="underline">Fascism as Liberal Failure</p>
            <!-- WW1 as a continuous coup -->
            <p class="underline">Fascism as the completion of Risorgiemento</p>
            <p class="underline">Fascism as capitalism in crisis</p>

            <h3>Short Summary</h3>
            <p>The Italian conquests in Africa were heavily influenced by the racist idea that Europeans "should" have a colonial empire. The wars in Africa 
                themselves then came back and influenced the development of Fascist racism in the 1920s and 1930s. To maintain their empire the Fascists 
                justified violence against Africans using white supremacy. While antisemitism had always existed in Italy, it was usually along religious lines rather than 
                "biological" inheritable race. However, as Fascists relied on ideas of race to justify the oppression of Africans, they then used race to justify the oppression 
                of Jews as well. This culminated with the 1938 <em>Manifesto of Racial Scientists</em> and the subsequent laws passed by the Fascist Grand Council. Despite the 
                horrific crimes of the Fascist regime many of these atrocities have been under-represented in Italian culture and historical study due to political and cultural stigmas.</p>

            <h3>Genocide in Libya</h3>
                <p>Libya had maintained a staunch anti-colonial religious society called the Sanusiyya Order from the late 1800s. When the Italians 
                    invaded and occupied Libya in 1911, they came into immediate conflict with the Sanussi<sup>1</sup>. Libya was where the Italian 
                    government began their racist policies, even before the Fascists took power. The Italians sought to break the power of the Sanusi order 
                    by exiling known members of the group, and between 1911 and 1928 exiled around 1,500 people into prison-colonies<sup>2</sup>. Mussolini's 
                    plan to re-create the Roman Empire caused a severe escalation of Italian racism beginning in 1928.</p>
                <figure class="center">

                </figure>
                <p>In 1928 Mussolini ordered the generals in charge of the Libyan campaign - Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio - to "pacify" Libya at all costs. 
                    Pietro Badoglio considered the population of Libya - mostly rural tribesfolk - to be an acceptable cost. To "pacify" Libya he 
                    planned to build concentration camps to hold the entire population of the northeastern region of Libya. In a letter from June 1930 
                    Badoglio said about the plan:</p>
                <p class="center bigger">"I do not conceal from myself the significance and the gravity of this action which may well spell the ruin of the so-called subject population."<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>The concentration camps began construction in 1928, and ran until 1934. Over that period of time the Fascists forced over 100,000 Libyans into the camps. 
                    Death did not begin in the camps, but on forced marches across hundreds of miles of open desert. The herds of Libyan tribespeople were also forced to march; 
                    some 80-95% of livestock - which the tribesfolk relied on for food and property - died<sup>4</sup>. The largest camps had conditions such as a 
                    complete lack of medical care, starvation-level rations, and no ability for those interned to wash or get new clothes<sup>5</sup>. Between 60 and 70 thousand Libyan people died 
                    during the genocide<sup>6</sup>. Hundreds of thousands of other Libyans were also forced to abandon their homes and flee the country.</p>
                <figure class="center">
                    <a href="img/colonists2.jpg"><img src="img/colonists2.jpg" title="The Abyar concentration camp shown from above." alt="An old photograph of the Abyar concentration camp in Libya taken from above." class="italImage"></a>
                    <figcaption>The Abyar concentration camp shown from above, 1930</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The legacy of genocide is still felt in Libya, and largely ignored in Italy. Survivors of the concentration camps, and their children and grandchildren, 
                    are alive today. Because of low literacy rates among tribespeople, the genocide is mainly remembered through poetry and oral tradition. This includes 
                    epic poems by those interred in camps such as Rajab Hamad Buhwaish al-Minifi's <em>Mabi-Marad</em> (I have no Illness except Agaila Concentration Camp) 
                    and Fatima 'Uthamn's <em>Kharabin Ya Watan</em> (Our Homeland Ruined Twice)<sup>7</sup>. <em>Mabi-Marad</em> was played often on radio stations 
                    throughout Libya in the 1950s, and is easily recitable for many Libyans<sup>8</sup>. The genocide is mostly unknown or ignored in Italy. 
                    The Italian government only tacitly accepted responsiblity for atrocities - but not genocide - in Libya as recently as 1998. The General Rodolfo 
                    Graziani, known as the "Butcher of Libya", had a statue erected in his honor in his hometown in 2012 dedicated to their "most famous of sons"<sup>9</sup>.
                </p>
            <h3>Development of Racism and Antisemitism in Law</h3>
                <p>Racism was not built into the legal framework of Fascism, at least initially. The Fascist party integrated a myriad of political ideologies into its 
                    coalition when it took power in 1922, and while some Fascists (such as Roberto Farinacci) were rabidly antisemitic and racist, others did not care much 
                    about the idea<sup>10</sup>. However, as Italy expanded into Africa, Mussolini became more personally interested in theories of racism. Within Italy there were 
                    many different "schools" of racism. The main two were the "Mediterranean" racists, who saw Italy connected to a Mediterranean-European identity, and the 
                    "Nordic" racists, who saw Italy as more connected to Germans in the north. Mussolini, and the racist movement in general, was indecisive about which model of 
                    racism to support, mainly depending on how relations were with the Nazis at any moment in time<sup>11</sup>. Because of this, when racism became integrated into 
                    Italian law it was controversial not just because it was racist but also because racism itself was divided in Italy.</p>
                <figure class="center">
                    <a href="img/colonists3.jpg"><img src="img/colonists3.jpg" title="Risiera di San Sabba Concentration Camp" alt="A modern photo of the Risiera di San Sabba, an extermination camp built by the Nazis in Italy." class="italImage"></a>
                    <figcaption>The Risiera di San Sabba compound, used by the Nazis as a concentration camp from 1943 to '45.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Italian racism developed as Italy invaded African countries such as Libya and Ethiopia. Mussolini felt that racism was a way to secure the empire<sup>12</sup>. 
                    It's hard to justify wars of conquest to your population if they view the enemy as living beings deserving of rights. As racism developed, so too did antisemitism. 
                    Hatred against the Jews had existed for centuries in Italy, but mainly through a religious lens thanks to the Catholic Church in Rome. However, beginning in the 1930s, 
                    Mussolini instigated a propaganda campaign to turn antisemitism into a "biological" concept. Being a practicing Jew was no longer what made someone Jewish; now 
                    all that was required was 3 Jewish grandparents. The development of racism and antisemitism was completed in 1938 when Mussolini sponsored the <em>Manifesto of 
                    Racial Scientists</em>, which decided on a "Nordic" model of racism and antisemitism. Immediately after its publication, the Fascist Grand Council passed a series of laws discriminating against Jews and Africans. 
                    The laws banned Jews and Africans from public schools, public jobs, membership in the PNF, interracial marriage, and from large property ownership<sup>13</sup>.</p>
                <p>While the outright genocide of Jewish people did not begin until Nazi occupation in 1943, the racial laws of 1938 created the legal basis for genocide in Italy. Genocidal 
                    practices in Africa by the Fascists had, in fact, inspired the Nazis, who adopted the Italian structure for their own concentration camps<sup>14</sup>. Part of the 
                    racial laws involved a census of all Jewish people in Italy. This census was then used by the Nazis to find Jews and send them into their camps.</p>
            <h3>Historiography</h3>
                <p>After World War Two, most historians focused on the rise and fall of the Nazi regime in Europe and ignored 
                    other Fascist movements within and outside of Europe. This was especially true of Italy for a series of political and cultural reasons. After the war the Italian Communist Party was the strongest Communist party in non-Soviet Europe, and both the US and the UK 
                    took that as "good reason" to not weaken the Italian right wing by attacking the Fascist regime<sup>15</sup>. Italian Fascists 
                    remained in charge of the Italian government archives after the end of the war. This allowed them to systematically remove, alter, or destroy 
                    documents showing the full extent of atrocities committed by Mussolini's regime<sup>16</sup>. Additionally, while Nazi officials 
                    were tried for their crimes, Italian officials were never tried. This was despite numerous attempts by the governments of Ethiopia and Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Within Italy, there was a desire to separate the Italian people from the evils of the Fascist regime. This led to the creation of the "Good Italian Myth", 
                    which states that most Italians secretly hated Mussolini but felt too threatened to do anything<sup>17</sup>. In this myth, the people of Italy are framed as innocent 
                    victims of the Fascist regimes, rather than perpetrators of the crimes. The Italian government has never felt much need to dispel this myth, especially with                     
                    the genocides and atrocities committed in African colonies.</p>
                <p>Because of this, historians - especially English speaking ones - have only recently began unpacking the nature of hatred in Fascist Italy. 
                    Some Italian historians began delving into Fascist anti-Jewish laws in the 1970s. The most comprehensive English book on Italian antisemitism 
                    was published in 2014. Only very recently have historians looked into the cases of Ethiopia and especially Libya. The Italian archives continue to be 
                    reluctant - at best - to release details on those atrocities<sup>18</sup>. Essentially the only comprehensive English book on the genocide in Libya written 
                    so far was published in 2021. Research on the oppression and ethnic cleansing of people in Fascist Italy is an ongoing process which affects the survivors and descendants of 
                    those atrocities today.</p>
