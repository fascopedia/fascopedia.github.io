            <h3>About this page</h3>
            <p>Fascopedia is a discontinued project of mine which I made in my senior year of college. The aim of the website was to provide a 
                freely available public resource on Fascist ideology, tactics, and the evils it committed in the 20th century. 
                The project began in December of 2023, during which time I completed one 
                article on the <a href="origins.html">origins of Fascism</a> and began writing a larger article about the history of Italian Fascism. 
                In February of 2024 I decided to 
                transition away from Fascopedia as an informal project and instead make my study of Italian Fascism 
                into my undergraduate <a href="genocide.html">thesis paper</a> in 
                university. Unfortunately, that led to the decision for me to discontinue Fascopedia as a website and to instead focus on writing my 
                 formal paper on the genocide the Italian Fascists committed in Libya in the 1920s and â€˜30s. I am still proud of what I made on this 
                website, and so I am leaving it up for anybody to browse. I am also adding a page where you 
                can <a href="genocide.html">read the paper I wrote about Libya</a>, although 
                you should be aware that this is a piece of formal historical academic writing and so it will be less accessible than the short origins article. 
                I still plan on creating new websites about history in the future, and possibly resuming work on this in the long-term, and I will be providing 
                updates on those projects to anybody who is interested. Thank you for reading anything on this website - I deeply appreciate anybody who finds 
                interest in the history I love researching.

            <ul>
                <li>7.27.2024: Swan-song update to archive the website. Unfortunately after spending months studying Fascism for my formal research paper I am rather 
                    tired of learning about the evils of the world, and would much prefer to start a new project than revive this one.
